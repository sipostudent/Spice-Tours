          <h2 class="titleText"><span>A</span>bout Grenada</h2>
          <p>In the far south of the Caribbean, Grenada is known as "the Spice Island" for the fragrant nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, vanilla, and cocoa that flourish in its fertile volcanic soil. The nation of Grenada also includes the two smaller and quieter islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique, northeast of the mainland. If you're seeking an authentic <a href="https://www.planetware.com/caribbean-travel.htm" target="blank">Caribbean</a> experience, Grenada offers an appealing mix of local culture and colonial roots, as well as rainforests, lush mountains, colorful seaside villages, plantations, and beautiful beaches framed by frangipani and flamboyant trees.
            <br>
            <br>St. George's, Grenada's capital, is one of the prettiest cities in the Caribbean, and the busy harbor of Carenage here bristles with sailboats. Many visitors spend their time around nearby Grand Anse Beach, one of the <a href="https://www.planetware.com/caribbean/best-beaches-in-the-caribbean-cay-1-2.htm" target="blank">best beaches in the Caribbean</a>, but Grenada offers more than just golden sands. Waterfalls gush in the island's interior, hiking trails thread through the lush rainforest, and coral reefs rim the coast. Swimming, diving, snorkeling, and fishing are all popular activities in Grenada's turquoise waters, and history buffs will enjoy exploring the country's forts and museums

            <h3>1. Grand Anse Beach</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Fringed by sea grapes, almond trees, and coconut palms, Grand Anse is Grenada's most famous beach. Cruise ship visitors flock to this three-kilometer arc of golden sand and gentle surf. Water hues range from clear turquoise in the shallows to deep cobalt blue, and the calm waters are perfect for swimming. Many hawkers patrol the sands, but a polite "No, thank you" will keep them at bay. If you feel like indulging in a little shopping, midway along the beach is the <b>Grande Anse Craft and Spice Market</b>, another popular stop for cruise ship visitors.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Gleaming beaches, glamorous guest rooms, and gourmet cuisine are just some of the features of the best luxury all-inclusive Caribbean resorts. Knowing your stay includes food, beverages, and many activities means you can relax and enjoy your vacation without worrying about hidden extras.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Many boutique resorts and restaurants lie along the shores of Grand Anse. Steps from the sand <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-s1-g1182535-d148386-Reviews-Spice_Island_Beach_Resort-Grand_Anse_South_Coast_Saint_George_Parish_Grenada.html" target="blank">Spice Island Beach Resort</a> is one of the island's most famous boutique hotels and one of the <a href="https://www.planetware.com/caribbean/best-luxury-all-inclusive-resorts-in-the-caribbean-bah-1-2.htm" target="blank">best luxury all-inclusive resorts in the Caribbean</a>.</p>

            <h3>2. St. George's</h3>
          </div>
          <p>One of the prettiest port towns in the Caribbean, St. George's curves along a horseshoe-shaped harbor backed by volcanic hills. This colorful capital of Grenada is popular with boaters, who dock in the busy harbor of Carenage. Brick and stone buildings with red-tiled roofs line the streets, where locals sell spices and crafts. Two of the main historical attractions in the city are <b>Fort George</b>, built by the French in the early 18th century, and <b>Fort Frederick</b>. Both offer beautiful views over the town and sea.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Housed in a 1704 French barracks and former prison, the <b>Grenada National Museum</b> displays a hodgepodge of historical items, including Carib and Arawak artifacts and exhibits on the sugar and whaling industries. Right nearby, the <b>House of Chocolate</b> is a must-visit for cocoa fans, with exhibits on the local cocoa industry and decadent sweet treats. To soak up some local color and buy fresh tropical fruits and spices, stop by the popular Saturday morning market at <b>St. George's Market Square</b>.</p>

            <h3>3. Underwater Sculpture Park</h3>
          </div>
          <p>On the west coast of Grenada, a short drive north of St. George's at Moliniere Bay, the Underwater Sculpture Park is a unique submerged gallery that also serves as an artificial reef in a marine protected area. Created by artist Jason deCaires Taylor, the sculptures range from Amerindian petroglyphs to life-size figures cast from local children. Divers, snorkelers, and glass bottom boat passengers can admire this underwater exhibition, although coming face-to-face with these sculptures below sea level is the best way to appreciate their artistry.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The park draws divers and snorkelers away from the few nearby fragile reefs which were not affected by Hurricane Ivan, including adjacent Flamingo Bay, which attracts large numbers of tourists. The sculpture park was instrumental in the government designating the area a marine protected area. Entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers to manage tourism and fishing quotas.</p>

            <h3>4. Fort Frederick</h3>
          </div>
          <p>At the end of winding hairpin turns atop Richmond Hill, Fort Frederick offers stunning views of St. George's and the sea. The fort has an interesting history. The French began construction of Fort Frederick in 1779, and the British then completed it in 1791. It is nicknamed the "backwards facing fort" because its cannons face inland instead of out to sea, thanks to the French who feared a surprise land attack after they used this successful strategy with the British. In 1850, the fort was abandoned completely until it was later occupied by the Grenadian military.</p>

            <h3>5. Fort George</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Built in 1705 by the French, Fort George lies on the promontory to the west of the harbor and is Grenada's oldest fort. It was built to protect the harbor, but stands mostly derelict today. The main draw here is the spectacular 360-degree view across the town's red-tiled roofs and church spires to the harbor and sea beyond. Be prepared for a hot and steamy hike up a flight of stairs to reach the fort.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Address: Church Street, St. George's</p>

            <h3>6. Carenage</h3>
            <p>The inner harbor and anchorage, known as the Carenage, is a lovely place to wander along the waterfront, browse the shops, and watch the dockside activities. Wooden schooners are loaded and unloaded here, and you can chat with the locals or relax at one of the restaurants selling fresh seafood and snacks. Wharf Road runs along the harbor offering great views of the area. Look for the bronze <b>Christ of the Deep</b> statue donated by the owners of a luxury liner in gratitude for local rescue efforts after the ship exploded off Grand Anse.</p>

            <p>I am far from an expert on the Caribbean but have travelled quite a bit to other parts of the world. I find it difficult to agree with the brochures that capital St Georges is 'lovely' 'beautiful' 'the best town in the Caribbean' If this is the case then there must be some pretty dismal towns around.</p>

            <p>We had heard that the Grenadians were lovely, but the some of hotel staff quashed that thought somewhat. But the 'real' people we met, such as taxi drivers, the crew on the cataraman trip, shop workers etc were truly lovely. Also, at the hotel the housekeeping and gardeners were always friendly.</p>

            <p>People very nice and friendly. The beaches are clean and deserted.
              Grand Anse beach had locals trying to sell trinkets which was a bit of a pest, but there are quite a few other beaches close to restaurants near to the airport which were just as good. All beaches in Grenada are public, do not let anyone tell you otherwise.
